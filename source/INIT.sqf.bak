//  HOW TO MANUALLY CREATE THE MISSION:   
//  1)YOU MUST PLACE THE HQ LOCATION
//  2)DEFINE THE CAPTURABLE ZONES
//  -- YOU CAN ALSO JUST PUT A HQ SOMEWHERE AND LET THE ZONES BEING RANDOMLY GENERATED
//  -- YOU MUST PLACE MANUALLY THE HQ IF YOU ARE ALREADY PLACING THE ZONES BY HAND 
//  3) DONT FORGET TO DEFINE THE VARIABLES BELOW. If you are ONLY placing the HQ by hand, you just need to put "hq_manually_placed" to "true" instead of "false". If you are also placing the zones by hand, make "zones_manually_placed" to "true".
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//  1) In the gamelogic, for the HQ( !! MAKE ONLY ONE HQ !!): _null=[getpos this] execVM "initHQ\BluHQinit.sqf" 
// 
//  2) In the init of gamelogic, to create a capturable enemy zone: _null = ["zone name",pts awarded upon capture, zone radius,getpos this,false/true,false/true] execvm "createzone.sqf";
//  "zone name": name of the zone
//  pts awarded upon capture: points you earn when you capture the zone. Also the amount of points of army power you take and receive from the enemy after capture
//  zone radius: how large the zone is
//  getpos this: It's the position of the zone. The gamelogic actually. You don't have to modify this.
//  false/true: if the zone is fortified or not. If the zone is fortified, there will be a bit more enemies and they will be maning static defences if there are any
//  false/true: if the zone is selecting randomly a prefab base. Prefab is selected according to the zone radius. The bigger the zone, the bigger the prefab asset will be chosen.
//
//  EXAMPLE, in the init of a gamelogic you have placed on the map:_null=["OP Xander",20,200,getpos this,true,false] execvm "initZones\createzone.sqf"
//
//  3) Define these variables:

        if (isNil "opfor_ai_skill") then {opfor_ai_skill = [0.1,0.3];};    // set the skill range of ennemy AI
        if (isNil "blufor_ai_skill") then {blufor_ai_skill = [0.4,0.7];};    // set the skill range of friendly AI, from 0 to 1 (0 being completely dumb)
        hq_manually_placed = false;  // you must specify if you have manually placed HQ or not. false = HQ is randomly placed -- true = you have manually placed the HQ
        zones_manually_placed = false;  // you must specify if you have manually placed the zones or not. false = zones are randomly generated -- true = you have manually placed the zones
