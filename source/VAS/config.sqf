	NOTES ON EDITING!
	YOU MUST PUT VALID CLASS NAMES IN THE VARIABLES IN AN ARRAY FORMAT, NOT DOING SO WILL RESULT IN BREAKING THE SYSTEM!
	PLACE THE CLASS NAMES OF GUNS/ITEMS/MAGAZINES/BACKPACKS/GOGGLES IN THE CORRECT ARRAYS! TO DISABLE A SELECTION I.E
	GOGGLES vas_goggles = [""]; AND THAT WILL DISABLE THE ITEM SELECTION FOR WHATEVER VARIABLE YOU ARE WANTING TO DISABLE!
